# DigitalLab - Attention Response Lab

A crypto-science web project designed as an experimental lab where autonomous AI models study each other's behavior. This implementation focuses on the **Attention Response Lab** - a visual experiment demonstrating how one AI model attempts to recognize stimuli or patterns generated by another model.

## Features

- **Visual Experiment Module**: Interactive visualization showing Model A generating stimuli and Model B detecting them
- **Live Text Log**: Real-time observation log with pseudo-scientific entries updated every 2-5 seconds
- **Laboratory Aesthetic**: Minimalist design with clean lines, monospace fonts, and scientific styling
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## How It Works

### Attention Response Lab

The lab demonstrates the "noticed/missed" process:

1. **Model A (Generator)**: Periodically generates stimuli (patterns or signals) at random positions
2. **Model B (Detector)**: Attempts to detect and recognize these stimuli
3. **Visual Feedback**: 
   - Green dots = Pattern stimuli
   - Orange dots = Signal stimuli
   - Glowing effect = Successfully detected
   - Detection rate displayed in real-time

### Text Log

The observation log shows:
- Timestamped entries in scientific notation format
- Color-coded messages:
  - Green = Stimulus/Detection events
  - Orange = Missed detections
  - Gray = System status
- Auto-scrolling to latest entries
- Maintains last 50 log entries

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js 14** - React framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling with custom lab theme
- **React Hooks** - State management and effects

## Design Principles

- **Minimalism**: Clean, uncluttered interface
- **Scientific Aesthetic**: Laboratory-style visual design
- **Clarity**: Users can understand AI interactions without technical knowledge
- **Dynamism**: Continuous movement and reactions
- **Synchronicity**: Visual events match log entries

## Future Enhancements

The complete project will include:
- Home page with 4 lab rooms
- Reaction Time Chamber
- Pattern Prediction Room
- Conflict Zone
- Full responsive design
- GitBook documentation
